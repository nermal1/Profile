                    I was born and raised in Algonquin Illinois. I lived there for 20 years of my life. It was a great place not too 
                far from the city and not too far from the country. My favorite part about Algonquin is the Fox River. It is a 
                great fishing spot especially for smallmouth bass. If you or anyone you know were to go there I would recommend
                going to Riverbottom Ice Cream. They are local business and it tastes great.

                    I recently moved to Belvidere Illinois this summer. It is just to the east of Rockford so there is plenty to do. 
                    It is a much older looking town but once you get to know the place it is pretty nice. The roads are very fun to drive 
                    as most of them are just cruising through the countryside. I would reccomend going to the Apollo Theatre if there is a 
                    concert when you are there. It is a great music venue and right outside is the Kishwaukee river.

                I now am living in Carbondale just off the Southern Illinois Campus. I came to Carbondale because of all the great things
                I have heard about southern Illinois. From my short stay so far I can say this place lives up to expectations and some.
                The nature here is amazing, it doesn't even feel like I am in Illinois anymore. The mountains and trails are very beautiful.
                There is so much to explore here that I am sure you can always find something to do.

                One of my biggest goals growing up was to own a bass boat. More specifically I want to have a

                on the back. Now once I get a real job I want to be able to 
                afford that, but I also want to have a wife and kids one day so hopefully if I keep at it like 
                I have been everything will go to plan.

                I now have goals of wanting to get in and out of college in four years with a bachelors degree in computer science.

                a field of computer science, whether that be in software engineering or in app development.
